\section{Black Boundary $\Sigma$}

The black boundary $\Sigma$ is defined as the set of relational states
for which the projection $\Pi$ loses injectivity.

Formally:
\[
\Sigma := \{ u \in \mathcal{U} \mid \Pi \text{ is not injective at } u \}.
\]

$\Sigma$ is not an object, not a horizon, and not a physical entity.

It is a structural marker indicating the transition from
invertible to non-invertible projection.

Crossing $\Sigma$ does not invalidate calculations.
It invalidates physical reconstruction.

Beyond $\Sigma$, multiple relational configurations
correspond to identical observable states.

The black boundary therefore separates
\begin{itemize}
    \item physically interpretable domains,
    \item from formally admissible extensions.
\end{itemize}

$\Sigma$ is model-dependent and may shift
with changes in resolution, observability, or projection structure.
