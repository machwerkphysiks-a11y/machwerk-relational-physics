\section{Relational Full Space ($\mathcal{U}$)}

The relational full space $\mathcal{U}$ is the domain of all formally admissible
relational configurations.

$\mathcal{U}$ is not a physical space.
It has no geometry, no metric, no dimensionality, and no intrinsic ordering.

Formally, $\mathcal{U}$ is defined as:
\[
\mathcal{U} := \{ \mathcal{R} \mid \mathcal{R} \text{ is a consistent set of relations} \}
\]

Elements of $\mathcal{U}$ are not objects, events, or states.
They are purely relational structures.

No notion of distance, locality, or temporal succession exists in $\mathcal{U}$.
Such notions arise only after projection.

$\mathcal{U}$ is ontologically neutral.
No physical interpretation is assigned to its elements.

All physical descriptions originate from $\mathcal{U}$ via projection,
but $\mathcal{U}$ itself remains non-observable.

Expansion of $\mathcal{U}$ occurs only through the discovery of new
consistent relational structures,
not through geometric extension or dimensional augmentation.
