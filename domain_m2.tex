\section{Definition of $m_2$}

\subsection{Concept}

$m_2$ denotes the domain of projection
in which relational states remain uniquely recoverable.

$m_2$ is not a space,
not a dimension,
and not a physical layer.

It is a validity domain
for physically interpretable statements.

\subsection{Formal definition}

Let
\[
\Pi : \mathcal{U} \rightarrow \mathcal{M}
\]
be a projection.

Then
\[
m_2 := \{ u \in \mathcal{U} \mid \Pi \text{ is injective on } u \}
\]

Equivalently:
\[
u \in m_2
\;\Longleftrightarrow\;
\exists!\,\Pi^{-1}(\Pi(u))
\]

\subsection{Properties}

Within $m_2$:
\begin{itemize}
    \item physical quantities are well-defined,
    \item causal reconstruction is possible,
    \item comparisons between states are unambiguous.
\end{itemize}

Outside $m_2$,
formal computation may continue,
but physical interpretation is no longer unique.

\subsection{Epistemic status}

$m_2$ is not fixed.

It expands or contracts
with available resolution,
measurement access,
and relational distinguishability.

$m_2$ represents
the current boundary
of reliable physical description.
