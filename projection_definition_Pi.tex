\section{Projection $\Pi$}

A projection is a mapping from the relational space $\mathcal{U}$
into a restricted computational domain.

\[
\Pi : \mathcal{U} \rightarrow m
\]

The projection $\Pi$ is, in general:
\begin{itemize}
    \item information-reducing,
    \item context-dependent,
    \item not necessarily injective,
    \item not necessarily surjective.
\end{itemize}

Projection is the formal mechanism by which
relational structures become observable.

No statement about physical reality is admissible
without an explicit projection context.

Different projections may yield identical observable results
from distinct relational configurations.
This loss of distinguishability is a structural property of $\Pi$,
not of $\mathcal{U}$.
