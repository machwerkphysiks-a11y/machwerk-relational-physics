# Derived Physical Quantities

This directory defines classical physical quantities as *derived constructs*
within the MACHWERK framework.

No quantity in this directory is treated as fundamental.
All quantities arise from:

- relational process structures
- projection into observable domains
- stability within an injective validity region (m₂)
- admissibility under the CRA axiom

The purpose of this directory is **not calculation**,
but **formal legitimacy**.

It answers the question:

> Under which formal conditions may classical physical quantities
> be meaningfully stated at all?

---

## Scope

The quantities defined here are:

- not primitive
- not ontological
- not universally valid

They exist **only relative to**:
- a projection
- a validity domain
- a relational reference structure

Outside these conditions, quantities may remain formally writable,
but become **physically inadmissible**.

---

## Relation to the framework

All definitions in this directory depend on:

- the U-space (relational full space)
- projection-based observability
- injectivity and inverse mapping
- Schwarzgrenzen
- the CRA axiom

No new axioms are introduced here.

## Contents

The following quantities are treated:

1. Mass  
2. Time  
3. Energy  
4. Momentum  
5. Distance / Length  

Each file provides:
- a formal definition
- admissibility conditions
- boundary behavior
- explicit non-assumptions

## Reading note

These files do **not** explain how to *measure* quantities.

They explain **when statements involving these quantities
are physically meaningful**.

This distinction is essential to MACHWERK.
