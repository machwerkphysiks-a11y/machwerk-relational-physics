\section{Measurement and Observables}

\subsection{Measurement Problem}

Measurement is often treated
as interaction with reality.

MACHWERK treats measurement
as projection selection.

\subsection{Formal Definition}

A measurement corresponds to
choosing a projection
\[
\Pi_M : \mathcal{U} \rightarrow m_2
\]

\subsection{Observables}

Observables are not properties.
They are stable features
within a projection domain.

\subsection{Information Loss}

Measurement necessarily discards
non-projected relational structure.

This is structural,
not technological.

\subsection{CRA Enforcement}

Statements about measurement outcomes
must be invariant
under non-injective substitutions.

\subsection{Conclusion}

Measurement reveals projection structure,
not underlying reality.
