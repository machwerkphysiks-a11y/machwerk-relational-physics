\section{Emergence of Space and Time}

\subsection{Absence in $\mathcal{U}$}

The relational space contains:

\begin{itemize}
\item no spatial extension
\item no temporal flow
\item no metric structure
\end{itemize}

Space and time do not pre-exist.

\subsection{Projection Construction}

A projection
\[
\Pi_{st} : \mathcal{U} \rightarrow m_2
\]
introduces ordered comparability.

Spatial relations emerge
from stable relational neighborhoods.

Temporal relations emerge
from ordered comparison sequences.

\subsection{Derived Nature}

Space and time are derived coordinates,
not fundamental containers.

\subsection{Black Boundary}

Beyond the injective domain,
space and time lose uniqueness.

Multiple relational states
map to identical spacetime coordinates.

\subsection{Conclusion}

Spacetime is a projection scaffold,
not the stage of reality.
