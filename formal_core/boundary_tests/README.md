# Boundary Tests

This directory contains **formal boundary tests** for the MACHWERK framework.

These files are **not examples**, **not demonstrations**, and **not applications** in the usual sense.
They are **structural admissibility tests** operating at the limits of physical describability.

Each test examines whether a commonly used physical statement
remains **physically admissible** under the formal conditions defined by MACHWERK.

---

## Purpose

Boundary tests answer a single question:

> Under which formal conditions does a physical statement remain
> admissible once projection, relational consistency, and loss of injectivity
> are taken seriously?

The goal is **not** to reproduce known results.
The goal is to identify **where and why physical interpretation fails**,
even when equations remain formally valid.

---

## Formal Context

All tests are evaluated with respect to:

- projection-based observability  
- relational reference structures (U-space)  
- injectivity and inverse mapping  
- validity domains (m₂ / m₃)  
- black boundaries (Σ)  
- the CRA axiom (Consistency of Relational Applicability)

No additional assumptions are introduced.

## What Boundary Tests Are

Boundary tests are **formal stress tests**.

They explicitly operate:

- at projection boundaries  
- across injectivity loss  
- in regions where multiple relational configurations
  map to identical observables  

A boundary test may conclude that a statement is:

- fully admissible  
- admissible only within restricted domains  
- formally definable but physically inadmissible  

No interpretation is added.
No alternative dynamics are proposed.

## What Boundary Tests Are Not

Boundary tests are **not**:

- interpretations of quantum mechanics  
- competing physical theories  
- numerical simulations  
- phenomenological models  
- philosophical speculation  

They do **not** introduce:
- new constants  
- new forces  
- new dimensions  
- hidden variables

## Included Test Classes

### Bell-Type Admissibility Tests

Examine correlation statements of Bell type
under non-injective projection.

The tests do **not** challenge quantum statistics.

They check whether statements that distinguish
between underlying relational states
remain admissible when those states are
observationally indistinguishable.

Focus:
- projection collapse  
- gauge invariance  
- CRA consistency  

---

### Mass Attribution Tests

Examine whether mass-like quantities
can be treated as intrinsic properties
or must be regarded as projection-dependent relational constructs.

Focus:
- stability of mass definitions  
- admissibility across m₂ boundaries  
- collapse of ontological attribution  

---

### Time Correlation Tests

Examine time-correlated statements
when time is treated as a derived relational quantity
rather than a primitive parameter.

Focus:
- loss of ordering beyond injective domains  
- distinction between formal continuation
  and physical interpretability  

---

### Dimensional and Extension Tests

Examine claims of dimensional extension
without corresponding modification of the projection.

Focus:
- admissibility of higher-dimensional descriptions  
- distinction between formal extension
  and projective origin  

---

## Relation to the Book

The boundary tests correspond to formal analyses
presented in the book:

**MACHWERK — Formal Conditions of Physical Describability**  
(Print-on-demand, Amazon,ISBN 979-8-24410-846-0 release February 2026)

This repository does **not** contain the full derivations,
examples, or narrative context from the book.

It provides the **formal test scaffolding only**.

## Interpretation Rule

If a boundary test marks a statement as *physically inadmissible*,
this does **not** mean the statement is false.

It means:

- the statement cannot be uniquely grounded
  in observable relational structures  
- its interpretation exceeds the admissible projection domain  

This distinction is central to the MACHWERK framework.

## Reading Note

Boundary tests are intended for:

- formal verification  
- model comparison  
- methodological clarification  

They are not meant to be intuitive.
They are meant to be **unambiguous**.
