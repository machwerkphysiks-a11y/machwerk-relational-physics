\section{Dimensionless Ratios as Fundamental Quantities}

Within the MACHWERK framework,
only dimensionless ratios are fundamental.

Let
\[
R_i
\]
denote process rates.

Physical quantities are expressed as ratios:
\[
X_{ij} = \frac{R_i}{R_j}
\]

Absolute values are not physically meaningful.

All measurable quantities
must reduce to combinations of such ratios.

Dimensions arise only after projection.
