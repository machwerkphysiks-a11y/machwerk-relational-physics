\section{Projection Mapping}

A projection is a formal mapping from the relational reference domain
to an observable computation domain.

\[
\Pi : \mathcal{U} \rightarrow m
\]

A projection is not assumed to be injective.
Distinct relational configurations may map to identical observable states.

Projection is generally:
\begin{itemize}
    \item information-reducing,
    \item context-dependent,
    \item locally but not globally invertible.
\end{itemize}

Physical observability is defined exclusively through projection.
No observable quantity exists independently of a projection.

The inverse mapping $\Pi^{-1}$ exists only on injective subdomains.
Outside these domains, reconstruction of relational states is undefined.

Loss of injectivity does not invalidate computation,
but it removes physical interpretability.
