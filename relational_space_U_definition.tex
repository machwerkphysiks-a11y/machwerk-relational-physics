\section{Relational Space $\mathcal{U}$}

The relational space $\mathcal{U}$ is defined as the set of all
logically admissible relational configurations.

\[
\mathcal{U} := \{ \mathcal{R} \mid \mathcal{R} \text{ is a consistent set of relations} \}
\]

$\mathcal{U}$ possesses:
\begin{itemize}
    \item no metric,
    \item no dimensionality,
    \item no temporal ordering,
    \item no geometric structure.
\end{itemize}

Elements of $\mathcal{U}$ are not points, events, or states.
They are relational configurations only.

$\mathcal{U}$ is not a physical space.
It is a formal reference domain in which relational distinctions
are defined prior to observation.

All observable structures arise only through projection
from $\mathcal{U}$ into restricted computational domains.
