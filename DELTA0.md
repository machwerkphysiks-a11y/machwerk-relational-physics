## Δ₀ (Delta Zero)

Δ₀ is not a physical parameter, not a constant, and not a limit in the classical sense.

Δ₀ is a **formal boundary marker**.

---

### Motivation

In many physical models, expressions can be extended formally beyond their original
domain of validity.  
Such continuations may remain mathematically well-defined, yet their results can no
longer be unambiguously traced back to observable relational structures.

Δ₀ marks precisely this transition.

It identifies the point at which a statement remains formally expressible
but loses its unique physical interpretability.

### Formal Role

Let  
\[
\Pi : \mathcal{U} \rightarrow m
\]
be a projection from the relational reference space into an observable calculation space.

Δ₀ denotes the point at which a statement satisfies:

\[
\text{formal definability} \;\;\wedge\;\; \neg(\text{unique backprojection})
\]

Equivalently:

\[
\text{invertibility} \;\longrightarrow\; \text{undecidable}
\]

Δ₀ is therefore **not a numerical value**, but a **decision marker** within the formal
framework.

### Delimitation

Δ₀ is:

- not an analytical limit  
- not a regularization scheme  
- not a physical boundary  
- not a replacement for computation  

Δ₀ does **not** terminate a calculation.  
It marks the point at which the **physical meaning** of the calculation can no longer be
maintained.

---

### Relation to Black Boundaries

Δ₀ always appears in the vicinity of a black boundary.

While a black boundary describes the **structural loss of injectivity** of a projection,
Δ₀ marks the point at which a **specific computation** ceases to carry physical meaning.

The black boundary is structural.  
Δ₀ is operational.

### Function Within the Framework

Δ₀ allows:

- formal continuations to remain admissible  
- without assigning them physical interpretation  

This prevents mathematical artifacts from being mistaken for physical statements.

Δ₀ is **not** an abort condition.  
Δ₀ is a **marker**.

It separates what may be calculated from what may be physically asserted.
