\section{Relational State Space}

The relational state space $\mathcal{U}$ is defined as the set of all
internally consistent relational configurations.

\[
\mathcal{U} := \{ \mathcal{R} \mid \mathcal{R} \text{ is a consistent set of relations} \}
\]

Elements of $\mathcal{U}$ are not objects, events, or positions.
They are defined exclusively through relations between processes.

The relational state space possesses:
\begin{itemize}
    \item no metric,
    \item no intrinsic ordering,
    \item no spatial structure,
    \item no temporal parameter.
\end{itemize}

All structure observed in physical descriptions emerges only after
projection into an observable computation domain.

$\mathcal{U}$ itself carries no notion of distance, locality, or causality.
These properties arise solely as projection artifacts.
