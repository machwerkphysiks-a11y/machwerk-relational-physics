# Applications — Formal Use Cases

This directory contains formal applications of the MACHWERK framework.

All files in this directory:
- use only definitions from the formal core
- introduce no new axioms
- contain no physical interpretation
- contain no narrative explanation

Each application demonstrates how relational statements
can be evaluated for admissibility using:

- projection structure
- injectivity conditions
- m₂ validity domain
- Schwarzgrenze (Σ)
- CRA axiom
- TRD axiom

These applications are not simulations.
They are formal admissibility checks.

If a statement fails, it fails structurally — not numerically.
