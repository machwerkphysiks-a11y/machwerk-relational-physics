\section{Processes and Rates}

A \textbf{process} is defined as a distinguishable, repeatable activity
without assumed spatial location, temporal duration, or carrier.

Processes are not objects and do not possess intrinsic properties.
They are only identifiable through their relations to other processes.

Each process $P_i$ is associated with a process rate $R_i$.

The rate $R_i$:
\begin{itemize}
    \item has no absolute scale,
    \item is not directly observable,
    \item has no physical meaning in isolation.
\end{itemize}

Only ratios of process rates carry physical significance.

\[
X_{ij} := \frac{R_i}{R_j}
\]

All physically interpretable quantities in the framework
are constructed exclusively from such relational ratios.

Absolute values of $R_i$ are formally undefined and physically meaningless.
