\section{Injectivity and Invertibility}

A projection $\Pi : \mathcal{U} \rightarrow m$ is injective
on a subset $\mathcal{D} \subset \mathcal{U}$ if
\[
\forall u_1,u_2 \in \mathcal{D}:\quad
\Pi(u_1)=\Pi(u_2) \Rightarrow u_1=u_2.
\]

Injectivity is not a global property.
It is domain-dependent.

Only in injective regions does a formal inverse
\[
\Pi^{-1} : m \rightarrow \mathcal{U}
\]
exist.

Invertibility is therefore a local condition,
not a structural feature of the model.

Loss of injectivity implies that multiple relational states
collapse into identical observable representations.

This collapse does not indicate a physical singularity.
It marks the limit of reconstructability.

Physical meaning requires invertibility.
Formal computation does not.
