\section{Black Boundary}

The black boundary $\Sigma$ is defined as the set of relational states
for which the projection loses injectivity.

Formally,
\[
\Sigma := \{\, u \in \mathcal{U} \mid \Pi \text{ is not injective at } u \,\}.
\]

At the black boundary, distinct relational configurations
produce identical observable outcomes.

The black boundary does not mark a physical singularity.
It marks a limit of interpretability.

Beyond $\Sigma$, computations may remain formally valid,
but no unique physical back-reference exists.

The black boundary separates
physically admissible descriptions
from formally extendable but non-invertible continuations.
