\textbf{Projection Axiom}

Physical observability is not primitive.
It arises exclusively through projection.

Formally, there exists a mapping
\[
\Pi : \mathcal{U} \rightarrow \mathcal{M}
\]
from a relational reference space $\mathcal{U}$ into an observable calculation space $\mathcal{M}$.

No physical statement is admissible unless it is formulated
with respect to a projection $\Pi$.

Objects, locations, times and magnitudes are not elements of $\mathcal{U}$,
but structures that emerge only after projection.

Without projection, no physical interpretation is defined.
