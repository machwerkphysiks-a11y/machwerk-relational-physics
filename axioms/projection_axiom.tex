\section{Projection Axiom}

A physical description arises exclusively through projection
from a relational reference domain into a calculable representation.

Let
\[
\Pi : \mathcal{U} \rightarrow m
\]
be a projection from the relational domain $\mathcal{U}$ into a
calculable domain $m$.

The projection $\Pi$ is, in general,
\begin{itemize}
    \item information-reducing,
    \item context-dependent,
    \item not globally injective.
\end{itemize}

No physical meaning is assigned to elements of $\mathcal{U}$ directly.
Physical interpretation is defined exclusively on the image
\[
\Pi(\mathcal{U}) \subseteq m.
\]

Distinct relational configurations in $\mathcal{U}$ may correspond
to identical observable states in $m$.

This ambiguity is not a physical property,
but a structural property of the projection itself.
