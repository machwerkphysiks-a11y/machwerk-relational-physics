\section{U-Space}

The U-space $\mathcal{U}$ is the fully relational reference domain of the framework.

$\mathcal{U}$ contains no geometry, no metric, no time parameter and no preferred
coordinate system. It is not a physical space, but a formal space of admissible
relational configurations.

Elements of $\mathcal{U}$ are not objects but sets of relations:
\[
u \in \mathcal{U} \;\Longleftrightarrow\; u = \{ R_1, R_2, \dots, R_n \}
\]

All information in $\mathcal{U}$ is encoded exclusively in relational ratios.
No absolute quantities are defined.

Distance, duration, mass, energy and causality do not exist intrinsically in
$\mathcal{U}$ and can only emerge through projection.

$\mathcal{U}$ itself has no boundary. All boundaries arise only through the
properties of projection operators.
