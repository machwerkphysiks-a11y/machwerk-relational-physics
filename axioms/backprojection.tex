\section{Backprojection}

A backprojection is a formal attempt to reconstruct
relational states in $\mathcal{U}$ from observable states
in a projection space.

Formally, a backprojection is written as
\[
\Pi^{-1} : m \rightarrow \mathcal{U}.
\]

In general, $\Pi^{-1}$ is not a well-defined function.

A unique backprojection exists if and only if
the projection $\Pi$ is injective on the considered domain.

If $\Pi$ is not injective,
multiple relational configurations correspond
to the same observable state.

In such cases, backprojection is undefined
as a physical operation and may exist only
as a formal construction without interpretative meaning.
