\section{Projection}

Let $\mathcal{U}$ denote the relational reference space.

A projection is a mapping
\[
\Pi : \mathcal{U} \rightarrow \mathcal{M}
\]
into an observable calculation space $\mathcal{M}$.

The projection $\Pi$ is not assumed to be injective,
surjective, or information-preserving.

Distinct relational states
\[
u_1, u_2 \in \mathcal{U}
\]
may satisfy
\[
\Pi(u_1) = \Pi(u_2)
\]
without implying equivalence in $\mathcal{U}$.

Projection reduces relational degrees of freedom.
All observable structure arises from this reduction.
