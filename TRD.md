# Three-Reaction Dynamics (TRD)

Three-Reaction Dynamics (TRD) is **not** a physical model
and not a dynamical theory in the classical sense.

TRD is a **formal comparison framework**.

It defines the minimal relational structure required
to formulate stable, context-independent statements
about processes without introducing absolute reference values.

---

## Motivation

Physical statements are commonly formulated using pairwise comparisons:

- cause and effect  
- system and environment  
- signal and reference  
- object and observer  

Such binary comparisons appear sufficient at first glance.
However, they are **structurally unstable**.

A two-process comparison cannot distinguish between:

- an actual change of a process, and  
- a change of the reference context  

Any variation in a two-term ratio can always be attributed
either to the numerator or the denominator,
without a principled way to decide which interpretation is valid.

This ambiguity is not epistemic.
It is structural.

TRD introduces a **minimal third reference**
to resolve this instability.

## Minimal Relational Structure

Let three distinguishable processes be given,
characterized by their process rates:

\[
R_1,\quad R_2,\quad R_3
\]

No absolute meaning is assigned to the rates themselves.

The only physically admissible quantities are **ratios**:

\[
X_{ij} = \frac{R_i}{R_j}
\]

With three processes, a closed relational structure emerges:

\[
X_{12},\; X_{23},\; X_{31}
\]

These ratios are not independent.
They form a consistency loop:

\[
X_{12} \cdot X_{23} \cdot X_{31} = 1
\]

This closure property does not exist for two-process systems.

Only at this level does relational comparison become stable.

---

## Formal Role of the Third Process

The third process serves no physical role by itself.
It is not an observer, not a clock, and not a background.

Its function is purely structural:

- it breaks pairwise ambiguity  
- it separates process variation from reference drift  
- it allows internal consistency checks  

The third process acts as a **relational anchor**,
not as an absolute standard.

---

## Invariance Properties

TRD is invariant under global rescaling:

\[
R_i \rightarrow \lambda R_i
\quad \forall i
\]

All relational quantities remain unchanged:

\[
\frac{\lambda R_i}{\lambda R_j} = \frac{R_i}{R_j}
\]

No absolute scale enters the description.

This scale invariance is not imposed.
It follows directly from the relational formulation.

## What TRD Enables

TRD allows:

- separation of process change from context change  
- identification of model-dependent artifacts  
- comparison of incompatible descriptions via shared relations  
- stability analysis without absolute reference frames  

It provides a formal mechanism
to compare descriptions that cannot be directly mapped
onto one another in absolute terms.

---

## What TRD Is Not

TRD is:

- not a time evolution  
- not a causal model  
- not a physical interaction  
- not a dynamical law  

It does not describe *what happens*.
It describes *how statements can be compared*.

TRD is a structure of comparability, not of motion.

---

## Relation to Projection and Observability

TRD operates entirely at the relational level.

It does not require:

- absolute states  
- full backprojection  
- injective mappings  

For this reason, TRD remains formally applicable
even in regions where projection injectivity is lost.

---

## Relation to Black Boundaries

At black boundaries, pairwise comparisons fail.

Binary relations become observationally ambiguous
due to projection-induced degeneracy.

TRD remains applicable because:

- it relies exclusively on relational consistency  
- it does not assume unique backprojection  
- it operates prior to physical interpretation  

TRD therefore functions as a **pre-interpretative tool**
in regimes where conventional physical meaning collapses.

---

## Role Within the Framework

TRD is the minimal formal instrument
for comparing statements across models
within the same validity domain,
without introducing ontological commitments.

It allows relations to be tested
without asserting what the underlying entities are.

In this sense, TRD forms the **lowest operational layer**
above the U-space
at which meaningful comparison becomes possible.

---

## Structural Status

TRD is not an optional extension.

Any framework that relies on relational descriptions
implicitly requires a structure equivalent to TRD
to avoid pairwise ambiguity.

TRD makes this requirement explicit.
