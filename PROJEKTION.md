# Projection and Observability

Physical observability is not direct access to reality.
It is the result of a projection.

MACHWERK strictly distinguishes between the **relational reference domain**
(U-space) and **observable calculation spaces**.
This distinction is foundational and non-negotiable.

## The Projection Principle

There exists a mapping

\[
\Pi : \mathcal{U} \rightarrow \mathcal{M}
\]

where:

- \(\mathcal{U}\) denotes the fully relational reference space  
- \(\mathcal{M}\) denotes an observable calculation space  

The projection \(\Pi\) is **not a physical process**.
It does not describe dynamics, causation, or interaction.

It is a **formal assignment** that determines which relational structures
become representable as physical quantities.

## Structural Properties of Projection

Every projection is, by construction:

- information-reducing  
- context-dependent  
- not necessarily injective  
- not necessarily surjective  

These properties are **structural**, not technical.
They cannot be removed by improved measurement, higher resolution,
or more refined instrumentation.

Projection loss is not a failure of physics.
It is a consequence of representation.

---

## Observable Calculation Spaces

Observable physics takes place in **restricted calculation spaces**
defined by stable projections.

Such spaces are:

- not fundamental  
- not complete  
- not ontologically privileged  

They are **tools**, not carriers of reality.

Space, time, fields, particles, and observables
exist only as structures *within* such projected domains.

---

## Injectivity and Uniqueness

A projection is injective if and only if:

\[
\forall u_1 \neq u_2 \in \mathcal{U} :
\Pi(u_1) \neq \Pi(u_2)
\]

Only in injective regions are states
**uniquely distinguishable and reconstructible**.

Uniqueness is therefore:

- not a global property of physics  
- not guaranteed by theory  
- a **local property of the projection**  

Whenever injectivity fails, distinct relational states
collapse into identical observable representations.

---

## Backprojectability

Backprojectability does **not** mean that U-space can be reconstructed.

It means only this:

Observable states can be uniquely assigned
to a well-defined class of admissible relational configurations.

Once injectivity is lost, backprojectability is
**principally impossible**, not merely difficult.

No refinement of interpretation can recover it.

---

## Projection Is Not a Restriction of Reality

Projection does not restrict what exists.
It restricts what can be **physically interpreted**.

All relational configurations remain admissible in U-space.
Only their interpretation as physical states is bounded.

This prevents mathematical artifacts
from being misidentified as physical facts.

---

## Projection as a Reference Framework

The projection concept defines:

- where physical statements are meaningful  
- where they remain formally valid but physically undecidable  
- where interpretation must explicitly stop  

This is not a reduction of physics.
It is a **precision tool** for its domain of validity.

---

## Relation to the Black Boundary

Loss of injectivity under projection defines the **black boundary**.

The black boundary is therefore:

- not an object  
- not a region of space  
- not a physical entity  

It is a **property of the mapping** \(\Pi\).

Beyond this boundary, formal continuation remains possible,
but physical interpretation is no longer admissible.

Physics does not end there.
Interpretation does.
