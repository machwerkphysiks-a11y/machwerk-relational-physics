# Scope and Deliberate Limitations

This repository deliberately limits its scope.

It does not contain:

- numerical examples,
- simulations or algorithms,
- experimental predictions,
- physical constants,
- ontological claims,
- interpretations of quantum mechanics.

All such content exists only in the accompanying book.

The purpose of this repository is not explanatory completeness,
but formal precision.

Anything that cannot be uniquely mapped back through a projection
is allowed to exist formally, but is not interpreted physically.
